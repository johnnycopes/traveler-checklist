# Traveler Checklist

### Live demo: https://travellist.surge.sh/

A checklist used to help me pack for my work trips made with HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.

Goals of this project include:

- Write everything in TS with no framework
- Set up Webpack from scratch to better understand how it works
- Make an interesting layout that feels like that of an app, not a website
- Produce a clean, cool-looking app
